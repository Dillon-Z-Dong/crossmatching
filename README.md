# crossmatching
Python crossmatching tools designed for automated workflows and large datasets. 

Current catalogs:

(1) STRM (neural net classifications ['galaxy',''star','qso','unsure'] for all objects detected in Panstarrs DR1.)

(2) STRM_WISE (same as STRM except includes all PS1 and WISE photometry. More reliable photo-z's, less coverage than base STRM.)
